## Below are 30 practice questions for the E-commerce Sales Dataset (ecommerce\_sales\_500.csv).



I structured them into Easy (10), Medium (10), and Hard (10) levels.



### **EASY LEVEL (Basic Pandas Operations)**



1. Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows.
   
2. Check dataset shape (rows, columns).
   
3. Display column names.
   
4. Check data types of all columns.
   
5. Convert Order\_Date into datetime format.
   
6. Find total number of unique customers.
   
7. Find total number of unique products.
   
8. Count number of orders per city.
   
9. Find minimum and maximum price per unit.
   
10. Calculate total quantity sold across all orders.



### **MEDIUM LEVEL (Aggregation \& Feature Engineering)**



1. Create a new column Total\_Amount = Quantity \* Price\_Per\_Unit.
   
2. Create another column Final\_Amount after applying discount:
   
3. Final\_Amount = Total\_Amount - (Total\_Amount \* Discount\_Percent/100)
   
4. Find total revenue (sum of Final\_Amount).
   
5. Find top 5 cities by total revenue.
   
6. Find most sold product (based on total quantity).
   
7. Calculate average discount percentage by category.
   
8. Find total revenue generated per payment method.
   
9. Extract month from Order\_Date and calculate monthly revenue.
   
10. Find average order value per customer.
    
11. Identify top 10 customers based on total spending.

### 

### HARD LEVEL (Advanced Analysis \& Logical Thinking)



1. Find customers who made more than 3 orders.
   
2. Calculate customer lifetime value (CLV) = total spending per customer.
   
3. Identify repeat customers (customers who bought more than 1 product type).
   
4. Find which product generates highest revenue after discount.
   
5. Calculate revenue contribution percentage of each category.
   
6. Find city with highest average order value.
   
7. Detect outliers in Price\_Per\_Unit using IQR method.
   
8. Find correlation between Quantity, Price\_Per\_Unit, and Discount\_Percent.
   
9. Create customer segments:

   Low spender (< 25th percentile)

   Medium spender (25–75 percentile)

   High spender (> 75 percentile)
   
10. Find month with highest revenue growth compared to previous month.
